# Tuition-Revenue-Maximization
This project discusses the maximization on University of British Columbia (UBC)’s Undergraduate Tuition Revenue.

For every organization in society, the efficiency of operation is key to its development and improvement in its reputation in the industry. 
For a university like the University of British Columbia (UBC), although its revenue relies heavily on government grants and contracts and slightly on donations, the revenue it generates from student tuition is also essential to determine whether it can operate efficiently. 
Keeping all the expenses and other revenue constant, maximizing tuition revenue would lead to a higher profit. 
As a result, more money can be invested into the operation of UBC for the next year which improves the growth of the organization. 
Investments can be put into research in different areas as well as to improve campus facilities and infrastructures. 
With better facilities, researchers and students are more likely to conduct better research, which improves UBC’s reputation, and in turn brings more talented researchers and students to the university, generating a beneficial cycle. 
With the strike of COVID-19, many students have changed their plan at UBC, which impacts UBC’s tuition revenue. 
Maximization of tuition revenue is needed to help UBC remain profitable as well as operationally efficient.
